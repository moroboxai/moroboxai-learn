# Standalone HTML File

Embedding a MoroboxAI game in an `index.html` file, and coding the agent right
into that file, is a quick and easy solution for hacking with MoroboxAI from
anywhere.

## Caveat

This solution is quite limited compared to having a local
[Node.js][nodejs] environment.

It is also really only suitable for writing native JavaScript agents, as for
other languages you will face CORS errors when trying to import files from your
filesystem, forcing you to embed the code of the agent into the HTML, and
preventing you to benefit from features such as code formatting, syntax highlighting,
or multi-file agents.

If you are willing for a lightweight, and nearly zero install solution, that
offers more flexibility for writing agents in other languages, please check
out [Local HTTP Server][local-http-server].

## index.html

For the solution suggested here, you really only have to create an `index.html`
file anywhere on your desktop, then copy and paste the following content:

```html filename="index.html"
<html>
<head>
  <title>MoroboxAI Sample</title>
  <!-- Library for embedding the MoroboxAI player -->
  <script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/moroboxai-player-web@0.1.0-alpha.47/lib/umd/moroboxai-player-web.min.js"
  ></script>
  <!-- Framework required by some MoroboxAI games -->
  <script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/moroxel8ai@latest/lib/umd/moroxel8ai.min.js"
  ></script>
  <link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
  integrity="sha384-T3c6CoIi6uLrA9TneNEoa7RxnatzjcDSCmG1MXxSR1GAsXEV/Dwwykc2MPK8M2HN"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  />
</head>
<body class="container">
  <div class="row h-100 align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-auto">
      <!-- Root element of the player -->
      <div id="player"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Code of your agent
    class Agent {
      inputs(state) {
        return {
          up: state.ball.y < state.bars[0].y,
          down: state.ball.y > state.bars[0].y
        };
      }
    }
    
    // Initialize the player and load the pong game
    MoroboxAIPlayer.init({
      element: document.getElementById("player"),
      url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moroboxai/moroboxai-games/master/pong",
      autoPlay: true,
      scale: 1.5,
      agents: new Agent()
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Now open the file in your browser, and you should see the Pong game running,
with the bar on the left-side moving to follow the position of the ball.

Now you can easily modify the code of the agent in your preferred code editor,
reload the page, and see the changes!
