# Introduction

MoroboxAI offers various ways for you to code an agent, ranging from the
single-file single function agent with zero install, to the more complex
machine learning powered agent with a [Node.js][nodejs] install.

## Pong Game

In the next sections, you will learn how you can code an agent for the
famous Pong game. In this game, the bar on the right-side is controlled by
a builtin agent of medium difficulty that you cannot modify. On the other
hand, the bar on the left-side is controller by your own agent. A default
agent will be provided so you can see how it works out of the box.
However its strategy of following the ball it quite simple, and not enough
to beat the secret builtin agent.

## How to Get Started?

To help you decide what approach fits the best your needs, and where to go
next, here is a summary of the available solutions suggested in the next
sections for coding an agent.

### On the Web

Directly code the agent in the browser with the code editor available on the
pages of the games.

Pros:

-   Zero install
-   Quick prototyping
-   No need to run a local HTTP server

Cons:

-   Really basic code editor
-   Restricted to a single-file agent
-   Can't use external libraries

### Standalone HTML File

Embed a MoroboxAI game in an `index.html` file, and code the agent directly into that file.

Pros:

-   Zero install
-   Quick prototyping
-   No need to run a local HTTP server
-   Use your preferred code editor

Cons:

-   Restricted to a single-file agent
-   Can't use external libraries
-   Can't import external files because of CORS errors
-   Only really suitable for JavaScript agents

### Local HTTP Server

Run a local HTTP server, embed a MoroboxAI game in an `index.html` file,
and load the agent from a separate file.

Pros:

-   Quick prototyping
-   Close to real life conditions
-   Use your preferred code editor
-   Suitable for all languages supported by MoroboxAI

Cons:

-   Have to install a tool for running a local HTTP server

### With npm

Use [npm][npm] to setup a project configured with [Vite][vite] to easily
code, test, bundle, and distribute your agent.

Pros:

-   Close to real life conditions
-   Use your preferred code editor
-   Suitable for all languages supported by MoroboxAI
-   Can use external libraries
-   Can code any kind of agent
-   Can bundle your agent to a single-file for sharing with the community

Cons:

-   Have to install npm
-   Require some good knowledge on npm
