MoroboxAI offers a convenient way for quickly getting started with coding agents
right in your browser.

## Web Code Editor

On the page of each game available on the website, you can find the same
configuration with a player on the left, and a code editor on the right.
This code editor is your best choice for hacking around from anywhere,
and with zero install. For each game, it is preloaded with a default dumb
agent, and some help description, that can help you grasp the concept
of the game, and figure out how to write your own better agent.

However, the code editor voluntary has sparse features, because its goal
is to offer a quick solution for writing single file single function agents,
rather than being a full code editor that can compete with the one
installed on your desktop.
For that reason, it can quickly become too restrictive, and when it
happens, it is suggested that you setup a fully working environment with
the next section [On the Desktop][desktop].

Here is an example of what the player and the code editor look like.
On the top-right, you can select your preferred language for the agent from
the languages supported by MoroboxAI.
The Run button on the top-left allows you to inject the code into the game,
and see the agent come to life!

<PlayerEditor
    playerOptions={{
        gameId: "pong",
        width: 170,
        height: 128,
        scale: 0.5
    }}
    editorOptions={{
        agentUrl:
            "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moroboxai/moroboxai-games/master/pong/agent.*"
    }}
/>

Now that you are more familiar with the code editor, head to [JavaScript][javascript]
to learn more about the JavaScript API for writing agents.
