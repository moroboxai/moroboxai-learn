# Introduction

Welcome to MoroboxAI documentation!

## What is MoroboxAI?

MoroboxAI is a fantasy console designed as a playground for AI coding.

Unlike other fantasy consoles, MoroboxAI games doesn't have a menu, a start, or
an end.
Instead, a MoroboxAI game consists of a single gameplay loop that starts in the
middle of the action, and restarts itself whenever the game is over.

That single gameplay loop offers a unique challenge that you can try to solve by
coding an agent, could it be simple random inputs, or a complex neural network.

The goal of MoroboxAI is to offer a panel of challenges of varying difficulty,
through a collection of sandboxed games created by the community, for which you
can try to code an agent, plug it, and see the result right in your browser.

## Where to Start From?

MoroboxAI is an open-source community, and everyone is welcome to come code and
share agents for existing games, or to create and distribute new games
for the community.

If you are interested in coding an agent for a game, [/learn/ai-coding][ai_coding]
will teach you both how to code an agent and test it directly in your browser, and
how to setup a working environment on your desktop.

If you are interested in coding and distributing games to the community,
[/learn/game-coding][game_coding] will teach you how to do that, either with
a single HTML file and basic text editor, or by installing a working environment
with Node.js and npm.

If you are interested in embedding MoroboxAI on your website, you can take a look
at [/learn/embedding][embedding].

## Status of MoroboxAI

MoroboxAI, and this website, are still in alpha, and under heavy development.

While at this stage everything starts to become more stable, many breaking
changes are happening there and there.
